# generation_DrugEx
This repository contains all scripts used to generate molecules using DrugEx, a de Novo generative algoritm of drug-like molecules[1,2,3]. These scripts have been adapted from DrugEx version 3 (https://github.com/XuhanLiu/DrugEx) to enable generation of molecules that contain a fixed scaffold. Further instructions on how to run this code can be found on the respective github page. Drugex is being further developed and the most recent version can be found on https://github.com/CDDLeiden/DrugEx.
