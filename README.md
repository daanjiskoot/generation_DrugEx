# generation_DrugEx
This repository contains all scripts used to generate molecules using DrugEx, a de Novo generative algoritm. These scripts have been adapted from DrugEx version 3 (https://github.com/XuhanLiu/DrugEx) to enable generation of molecules that contain a fixed scaffold. Drugex is being further developed and the most recent version can be found on https://github.com/CDDLeiden/DrugEx.
